We are the **University of Ottawa Aerospace research and competition team**. Our mission is to provide students with the opportunity to learn and apply engineering principles through hands-on projects, competitions, and research initiatives. We aim to instill the next generation of engineers a passion for aerospace while using the necessary skills to excel in this dynamic field. Our primary focus is on the design, construction, and testing of aerospace projects, with a particular emphasis on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

## Our team

Aero uOttawa is divided into three main subdivisions: **Competition, Research and Development (034 Labs), and Outreach**.

* **Aero uOttawa Competition** is dedicated to the design and development of vertical and short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) UAV systems. Our competition efforts provide a platform for our members to apply their technical knowledge, creativity, and problem-solving skills in a real-world context. This yearâ€™s design challenges revolve around system autonomy; in-flight configuration changes autonomous payload pickup and delivery.

* **034 Labs by Aero** is our R&D subdivision focused on exploring novel designs and cutting-edge technologies. The 034 Labs team is committed to pushing the boundaries of aerospace engineering and developing solutions that could have a significant impact on the industry.

* **Aero uOttawa Outreach** is responsible for sponsor relations, recruitment, merchandising, social media, and event organization. With the support of the university and its partners, we aim to create events providing students with early exposure to aerospace engineering and inspiring the next generation of engineers.
