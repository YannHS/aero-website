We are the **University of Ottawa Aerospace research and competition team,** a team of undergraduate students who are passionate about advancing and utilizing our engineering skills, knowledge, and experience outside a classroom.

## Located in Canada's capital, we build aircraft using modern technologies!
Every year, we enroll in a competition event where we build the best aircraft we can. Sometimes this means using autopilot systems to fly autonomously, using cutting edge fabrication to build the lightest aircraft or getting the best efficiency using advanced airfoil design.
