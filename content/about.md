## Located in Canada's capital, we build aircraft using modern technologies!
Every year, we enroll in a competition event where we build the best aircraft we can. Sometimes this means using autopilot systems to fly autonomously, using cutting edge fabrication to build the lightest aircraft or getting the best efficiancy using advanced airfoil design.
